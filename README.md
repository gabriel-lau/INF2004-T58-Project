# INF2004-T58-Project

## WEEK 10
From Prof Fauzi ([Source](https://xsite.singaporetech.edu.sg/d2l/le/110338/discussions/threads/64202/View)):
```
I just need you to show us the following drivers that work:


Motor Control: function(s) that can move the motor forward/backward and various speeds and turn left/right

Ultrasonic: Can measure distance with good accuracy (e.g. within centimetres). Better grade if you can do it using interrupts.

Wheel Encoder: Can measure the distance traversed and speed. Better grade if speed is measured using pulse width.

IR Sensor: Detect line for line following and measure pulse width for barcode.

WiFi: Able to send/receive messages from PC/Laptop to Pico.

Magnometer: Able to obtain the accelerometer and magnometer data correctly. (data refreshes properly).

They can all be separately demonstrated. Code MUST be uploaded into GitHUB in their respective folder, e.g. 

\driver
     \motor
     \irline
     \ultrasonic
     \wifi
     \encoder
     \magnometer

Let me know if there is something that needs clarification.
